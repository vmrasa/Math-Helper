# Math-Helper

Math-Helper is a website aimed to help children in the art of mathematical problem solving.

The player names their character and embarks on a pseudo-randomized quest for
the lost treasure of Captain Peg-Leg.

The game flows between a variety of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,
and even some simple algebra. The difficulty of these problems will adjust based
on the player's proficiency with their current problems.

Upon completion, the game will display results and provide links to websites which may 
further supplement the child's learning needs.
